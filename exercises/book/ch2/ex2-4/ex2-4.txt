a) 
B2 has a value of 0.4 and reached its lower bound (700). This tells me that the lower
bound for vitamin B2 should be relaxed in order to make minimize the cost(?).

The opposite is true for vitamin NA. In the current diet, this has reached its upper bound,
and the negative value for the "reduced cost" here tells me that the upper bound should be
relaxed (increased) in order to make the model more optimal (i.e. minimizing the cost eeven more?).

b)
To save money I would eat more than 10 packages of MCH. The "reduced cost" of this
variable has the lowest value of all the ones which has reached the upper bound.
Relaxing the upper bound on this package would bring the RC value closer to 0.
